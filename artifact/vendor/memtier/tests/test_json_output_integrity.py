"""
Regression tests for the JSON output produced by --json-out-file.

These tests pin down the invariant that latency fields in the JSON output
are internally consistent. They were added after RED-191460, where the
"Totals" section reported "Latency": 1.000 (or 0.000 for sub-millisecond
workloads) regardless of the actual value, because the underlying field
was an integer that truncated the averaged result. Checking only that
Latency > 0 is not sufficient — the bug could re-emerge with a similarly
plausible-looking but wrong value. The invariant we check here is:

    Latency ~= Accumulated Latency / Count

for every section that exposes those fields (Sets, Gets, Totals, BEST/WORST/
AGGREGATED, and the per-second time-series buckets).

    final summary where Ops/sec, Hits/sec, Misses/sec and KB/sec all rendered
    as 0.00 even though Count and Latency were correct. Root cause:
    client_group::merge_run_stats() iterated all clients (including those
    that were prepare()-d but never reached set_start_time()) and merged
    their zeroed m_start_time into the factorial average, dragging the
    aggregate m_start_time toward the epoch. With m_end_time correct but

    flag plus a has_started() guard in merge_run_stats() and
    aggregate_inst_histogram() that skips clients that never started.
